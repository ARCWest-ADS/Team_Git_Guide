# A guide on utilising this GitHub organisation!
In this short repository we will try and explain some basic GitHub functionality as well as its place within the Applied Data Science team and what should be deposited here.

## **Why** and **What** is GitHub?
GitHub is a versioning platform for code and is an excellent place for team members to collaborate on research. This platform will also allow us to condense and centralise universally used code.
Nowadays journals love _public_ and _open source_ code so that other researchers can replicate work. GitHub will allow us to freely host this code and create a permanent link for future reference and publications.
