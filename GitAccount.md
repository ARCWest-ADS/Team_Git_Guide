## Access to the ARCWest-ADS team Github organisation
* Very simply just provide your Github username to <matthew.bird@bristol.ac.uk> or via message on Teams and I can facilitate this. You will get an email asking to accept the invitation, after which you will be a member of the organisation with the appropriate permissions.
* Whilst you are waiting you can customise your account with a profile picture, public email, link to your LinkedIn/ORCID ID and/or a short Bio  

## You now have a Github account within the ARCWest-ADS organisation!!
