# Github functionality
A short tutorial on how to create, edit and deposite your code into a Github repository.

## Creating a Github repository
1. To ensure you don't create a personal repository and instead one within the organisations Github first navigate to [ARCWest-ADS repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ARCWest-ADS/repositories) and look for the green `New repository` button in the top right.

2. You will then be greeted by the new repository mandatory settings such as **_name_** and **_visibility_**.
   - The repository name should be formatted in the following naming convention: Author_codebase_purpose. This repo is a slight exception to that rule as its Author is **_Team_** as its a tutorial.
   - Its a good idea to have the README.md box checked and set the visibilty of a Github repo to **_Private_** to start. Once all code is deposited then it can be set to **_public_**.

3. Your brand new and fresh Github repository is now ready for code and other essential files to be uploaded.
   - These can either be drag and dropped using the `Upload files` option or created from scratch using the `Create new file`.
   - As i suspect uploading files will be the most popular option just remeber to add a short description of the files you are uploading.
   - Make sure you are always commiting directly to the `main` branch to avoid uneccessary branches.
   - Once you press `commit` you should see these files in the repository.

## Cloning a Github repository
* Now that we have created this Githib organisation it will allow for the cloning (copying) of other team members code for further use and desemination.
* This is very easily achieved by navigating to the github repository you want to clone/copy (all ARCWest-ADS repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/ARCWest-ADS/repositories)) and clicking on the green `<> Code` option.
* This will give several option but for simple ease of clocning/copying we only need to click on `Download ZIP` which will download the repository as a ZIP file to your downloads folder.
